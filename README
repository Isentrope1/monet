Monet is an open source java command line Ethereum wallet tool that manages ETH and ERC20 tokens. Monet has a simple interface and allows you to:

* send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens: 
>> token add OMG 0xd26114cd6EE289AccF82350c8d8487fedB8A0C07 18
>> contact add bob 0x978097f6628b66b22df8b8d39284743c58e1542f
>> send bob 1.3 OMG
You choose sending wallet in following step. Popular ERC20 token definitions (eg OMG) are included.

* check wallet positions values in USD using token price information from coinmarketcap.com
>> wallet

* easily MAKE YOUR OWN ERC20 token: 
>> token make <name> <quantity>
Tokens created this way use HumanStandardToken.sol as solidity contract. When creation is completed, created token will be added to your token list. You can then transfer it to others.
